# Introducing ineventer

** Where friends, family, and associates can re-invent how they plan events! 

We all know the process of bringing people together for an event can be tough. You have to create a group chat or find another contact method to let everyone you want to invite know. Then everyone has to say when they are or aren't available. Some might have something come up that they weren't expecting that makes them now unavailable at that time.

With all the moving parts of setting up an event, there's a whole host of potential potential issues that can arise and jeporadize the event from happening. 

At the heart, events are planned through good communication. This is what ineventer aims to facilitate.
